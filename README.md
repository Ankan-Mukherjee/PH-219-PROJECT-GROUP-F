ROOT TASK GROUP F

1. USE STAR DEFINITION AND NOT ALICE
2. pT STANDS FOR TRANSVERSE MOMENTUM
3. phi STANDS FOR AZIMUTHAL ANGLE
4. eta STANDS FOR RAPIDITY
5. rap STANDS FOR PSEUDO-RAPIDITY
6. THERE ARE entries NUMBER OF EVENTS. EACH EVENT CONTAINS ARRAYS OF pT, phi, eta and rap

GRAPHS TO PLOT

1. Histogram for pT and EXPONENTIAL FIT for each and every multiplicity class. (x6)
2. Histogram for <pT> and GAUSSIAN FIT for each and every multiplicity class. (x6)
3. Graph of <pT> vs multiplicity class.
4. Graph of sqrt(delta pi delta pj)/<<pT>> vs multiplicity class.
5. Graph of Standrad skewness vs multiplicity class.
6. Graph of Intrinsic Skewness vs multiplicity class.
